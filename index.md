Legislate This! is a show like none other; a politically fueled burlesque extravaganza pulsing with performers at their finest! And the best part? All of the profits go to the local Planned Parenthood chapter!

Legislate This! was started in Austin, TX by local performer Ginger Snaps in April of 2012. The first show was a resounding success raising over $2,200 for Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas. If you’re interested in producing a Legislate This in your neck of the woods, email Ginger at [gingersnapsburlesque@gmail.com](mailto:gingersnapsburlesque@gmail.com)!

Legislate This! began in Austin, TX as a reaction to the perils of having Rick Perry as our governor. Tired of feeling marginalized and looked down upon for having a vagina, Ginger Snaps decided to fight back the best way she knew how, by hosting a fundraiser!

Occasionally creativity wins out above immaturity, and that’s how great events are born! Over the past couple of years Legislate This has raised thousands of dollars for Planned Parenthood chapters across the country and we’re excited to continue this momentum!
