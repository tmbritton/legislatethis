Awesome! Here is some important info:

- Legislate This! is a benefit show for Planned Parenthood. As such, no less than 80% of money made must go to Planned Parenthood.
- You will need to speak with your local Planned Parenthood chapter to fill out necessary documents and get event approval.
- For maximum impact, we are aiming to have all shows take place nationwide between May 9th and May 12th.
- Upon event approval, we will provide you with some logos and marketing material, as well as getting the link to your event listed on this website.
- If youâ€™d like to produce a show, please contact Ginger at [gingersnapsburlesque@gmail.com](mailto:gingersnapsburlesque@gmail.com)
- Thanks so much  for your interest!!!
