Legislate This! began in Austin, TX as a reaction to the perils of having Rick Perry as our governor. Tired of feeling marginalized and looked down upon for having a vagina, Ginger Snaps decided to fight back the best way she knew how, by hosting a fundraiser!

Occasionally creativity wins out above immaturity, and that’s how great events are born! Over the past couple of years Legislate This has raised thousands of dollars for Planned Parenthood chapters across the country and we’re excited to continue this momentum!
